*NOTE*: Development on this repo has ceased. The project has been rewritten in python 
and is available at [orthocal-python](https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-python).

Orthocal provides Go tools for the Orthodox Calendar. This code is based on the
[orthodox_calendar](https://github.com/paulkachur/orthodox_calendar) project by
Paul Kachur.
